## 1. Additional Restrictions

### 1.1 Cloud-Agnostic Agent Platform Prohibition

You may not use the Software, directly or indirectly, to offer, enable, operate, or provide any **Cloud-Agnostic Agent Platform** to third parties, whether as a hosted service, managed service, platform-as-a-service, or otherwise.

### 1.2 Repackaging and Competing Services

You may not repackage, rebrand, or otherwise offer the Software's agent-building, multi-cloud deployment, or cloud-agnostic orchestration capabilities to third parties. This includes, without limitation:

- Offering a hosted service that allows users to build, deploy, or manage AI agents across multiple cloud providers
- Creating a competing "deploy anywhere" or "write once, run anywhere" agent platform
- Providing agent deployment services that leverage the Software's cloud abstraction capabilities
- Offering the Software's deployment targets (AWS, GCP, Local) as part of a commercial platform

### 1.3 Permitted Uses

The restrictions in Sections 1.1 and 1.2 do not prohibit you from:

**(a) Internal Use:** Using the Software to build and deploy your own AI agents for your own products, services, or internal operations, including deploying to any cloud provider.

**(b) Professional Services:** Using the Software to deliver bespoke agent solutions to individual clients, provided that:
- Only your personnel operate the Software
- Clients receive only the resulting deployed agent, not access to the agent-building or deployment capabilities
- You do not provide a multi-tenant platform where clients can build or deploy their own agents

**(c) Embedded Agents:** Integrating agents built with the Software into your products or services, where end users interact with the agent but cannot access agent-creation, configuration, or deployment features.
